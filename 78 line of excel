ENHANCEMENT 2  ZVIM_NOTIF_EMAIL_LINK_FIORI.    "active version

** Added by OpenText PS | 15th Feb 2022

** Standard ZCON SIMPLE_EMAIL_APPR has an issue. If it is maintained, then all workitems wil have APPROVE REJECT option enabled in email notif.
** To avoid that, we are checking approval workitem and then constant set from custom ZCON ZVIM_APPR_CHECK.
** Slight modification done in standard code as well to check "lv_constant" is initial or not. Otherwie value will be overwritten

DATA: lv_con TYPE /PTGWFI/VALUE.

"check the DP is in approval stage:
READ TABLE pt_data INTO DATA(ls_chk1) INDEX 1.
IF sy-subrc IS INITIAL.
  IF ls_chk1-CURR_ROLE = 'APPROVER'.

    CALL FUNCTION '/PTGWFI/CP_READCONSTANT'
      EXPORTING
        constname    = 'ZVIM_APPR_CHECK'
        productcode  = 'IAP'
      IMPORTING
        CONSTVALUE   = lv_con.
  ENDIF.
ENDIF.

ENDENHANCEMENT.


STANDARD CODE MODIFICATION :

** Simple Email Approvals Logic Starts
** Read Z-constant value and display Approval Actions only if 'X' value is returned
  CALL FUNCTION '/OPT/VIM_READ_CONSTANT'
    EXPORTING
      prod_code   = 'IAP'
      param_name  = 'SIMPLE_EMAIL_APPR'
